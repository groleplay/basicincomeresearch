        </h3>

        <p>
          My name is Xavier Fontcuberta and I’m an economist and policy evaluator currently based in Madrid (Spain).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been involved in BI research since 2003, when I first joined the Spanish Basic Income Network (<em>Red Renta Básica</em>), where I’m currently a member of its board. I co-founded the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis">Basic Incomes Studies</a> international academic journal, playing a central role in its launch and consolidation. For more than 6 years I was in charge of the budget and the workload, looking for extra funding and coordinating the editorial team with the Spanish network.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wrote <a target="_blank" href="downloads/Basic-income-and-the-quality-of-jobs-a-macroeconomic-equilibrium-approach--MSc-Thesis--Xavier-Fontcuberta.pdf" title='Basic Income and the Quality of Jobs: a Macroeconomic Equilibrium Approach'>my MSc thesis</a> on the labor market general equilibrium model by Nobel laureate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.basicincome.org/news/2016/02/international-christopher-pissarides-a-nobel-economist-argues-for-ubi-at-a-debate-in-davos/">Pissarides</a>, assessing the impact of a BI in the quality of jobs by considering the subjective utility people might draw from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve also been working as a social policy evaluator for the last 9 years. Systematic policy evaluation involves measuring people’s reactions to a given incentive scheme, so I have a broad practical expertise in designing and implementing surveys, indicators and related empirical techniques. In particular, I’m well trained and experienced in several <a target="_blank" href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/documents/Experimental%20Methodology%20Table.pdf">quasi-experimental</a> research methodologies, which I believe should be applied in experiments like this to ensure a rigorous scientific approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more than 12 years I’ve been studying and supporting BI. I know the state of the art precisely. I have studied the negative income tax experiments that were conducted in the US in the 1960s and 1970s, the Mincome experiment in Canada and other natural experiments like the The Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth. I also have a wide contact network among the international BI research community, in particular within the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.basicincome.org/about-bien/">Basic Income Earth Network</a> and among some of the experts directly involved in the current European BI experiments.
        </p>

          <a id="the-experiment" class="anchor" href="#the-experiment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The experiment
        </h3>

        <h4>How would I design this study</h4>

        <p>
          I would propose a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences">diff-in-diff</a> methodology with a strong control group. This will estimate the net effect of the BI and establish whether some decisions would have happened anyway, while it will show, for example, whether some other unobservable decisions (like <em>staying</em> in a fulfilling although not very well paid job) might have been taken thanks to the BI.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key when not having many recipients is to recruit a strong control group as big as possible, so for each BI recipient we track a lot of statistically identical people. That should allow to control for unexpected shocks: if a recipient gets fired, you might look into your control group for somebody in that same circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will also provide some interesting <b>quantitative results</b>: if, let’s say, wages rise (or fall) 10% on average in the control group, while for recipients they rise 25%, you can claim the 15% difference is due to the BI.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would also collect some extra information on possible explanatory variables, to allow for future multivariate regression exploitations. However, I think in this case a diff-in-diff approach has a clear advantage: everybody can understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> it works, while that won’t happen with the regression models.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, I would use surveys and personal interviews to include a <b>qualitative approach</b> in the study, by asking participants for their motives to take this or that decision. If a BI recipient quits her job to get a better paid one, then we have the kind of work disincentive that worries economists so much. But people might also quit their job in search of a better working atmosphere or even a less sexist one.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the experiment tracks whether those personal motives succeed, it will properly integrate your concerns about BI’s potential role in boosting economic performance, promoting equality of opportunity and fighting poverty.
        </p>

        <h4>Research focus</h4>

        <p>
          I would account for your concerns on <b>job destruction</b> by choosing participants among people who has a high probability of being fired, or people who is already unemployed and under social services (or maybe both if we have enough recipients). This would allow us to study the ability of BI to overcome public policies <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/12/29/the-excellent-dutch-experiment-into-the-universal-basic-income/#7f9d1e501980">poverty traps</a> of talented people, which is a major issue in the BI debate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding your interest in allowing the BI to <b>talented people</b> from poor backgrounds, we should first specify what do we have in mind by “talented” and how we spot them. Given that public policies and NGOs already try to support talented people (with grants and similar strategies), I would then focus on whether a BI performs better in boosting those people potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          In connection with the later, I believe studying BI effects on <b>women emancipation</b> is a potentially groundbreaking research question. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis.2008.3.3/issue-files/bis.2008.3.issue-3.xml">Feminism</a> has a mixed view on BI and is especially concerned whether women will leave the labor market to care for dependent relatives. However, under a BI women might also find their own successful strategies to remain in the labor market and, most importantly, to equally involve men in caring responsibilities. And those strategies might as well be more effective than current public policies. Studying this properly might require allowing the BI to both members of couples, but I firmly believe it will help BI supporters to bring feminism in.
        </p>


        <h4>Practicalities</h4>

        <p>
          According to my experience, practical problems associated with <b>data collection</b> are the Achilles heel for many researches, and they are systematically underestimated. That was the case of the NIT experiments in the US, where promisingly results for BI supporters were concealed by the tremendous amount of practical issues researchers had to face.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would put a strong emphasis in setting up a reliable surveying system to gather quality data on a regular basis (I figure YC expertise in IT could make a real difference here). Given that we want to ask lots of things to people in the control group, we might possibly need to “bribe” them with small incentives.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, I think <a target="_blank" href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/185418/1/The+journal+of+socio-economics.pdf">lotteries</a> like <em>Lucky 4 Life</em> are a very good way to replicate the long term incentive scheme posed by a BI. I thus would explore the possibility to expand the study by tracking lottery winners, what would be in line with YCR willingness to carry long-lasting researches. This would add more recipients cheaply and would allow to study the case where a BI is granted as a lump sum cash payment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last but not least, I would gather as much technical information as possible about the current European BI experiments (in The Netherlands and Finland), to ensure their complementarity with our experiment and to make use of their knowledge. In line with good software development practice, we shouldn’t invest time and money in rethinking what has already been proved to work.
        </p>


        <h4>Activities</h4>

        <p>
          The core tasks to perform would be to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Pose a limited and clear set of <b>research questions and hypothesis</b>. I would perform a light revision of the latest literature on BI to ensure we properly transform your concerns into the right research questions.
          </li>

          <li>
            Choose the <b>universe</b> we are going to study. This will involve selecting the place where to run the experiment and establish the optimal sample size, what will depend on which are the final research questions. The social background of people will be taken into account at this stage, as well as efficiency considerations on the project’s budget and how to optimize it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Prepare <b>data collection tools</b>. This will imply first to establish which are the exact concepts and variables we are going to measure. Then I will write the scripts for surveys and interviews, and consider what other information sources on participants could be used (i.e., official records).
          </li>

          <li>
            Set and write down the <b>Terms and Conditions for participants</b> in the experiment. Ethical and legal considerations should be taken into account here, as well as dealing with any official paperwork which may need to be written.
          </li>

          <li>
            Publicise the experiment and <b>enroll participants</b>. We should reach all potential participants, advert the experiment and perform a first lottery to ensure randomisation.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pilot <b>surveys and interviews</b>. It’ll be necessary to test the scripts to ensure people do understand the questions, answer all of them, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            Set up the <b>paying scheme</b>. This will involve to open a bank account, settle regular payments, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            Set up <b>contingency plans</b>. We need to anticipate the main issues that may arise and compromise the experiment, while establishing ways to fix them.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Launch the experiment</b>. I will start by running the first set of <em>ex ante</em> interviews, to assess as good as possible which are the conditions for all participants before the BI is set up. Later we will have a second lottery to select those who will be in the treatment group. This will also involve to properly announce the launching, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Measure, measure and measure</b>. If possible, we should check what happens to participants at least on a yearly basis. Personal interviews will be the most time consuming activity, so I’d perform interviews at three points in time (before launching, after 2 years, at the end), while I’d use surveys once a year. Also, to check what happens to participants long after the experiment is finished would also improve the experiment’s relevancy very much.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Finish the experiment</b>. This will involve stopping the money payments, to properly thank participants, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In addition to the former activities, I would perform several additional work to ensure it has the most relevant impact on BI research. In particular:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            At early stages I would intensely look for more funding, approaching other people or institutions which might also be interested in BI. For it to success we need to be very clear on what will be learnt by the experiment, and how it can boost people’s support to BI.
          </li>

          <li>
            I would explore the <em>Lucky 4 Life</em> approach to cheaply expand the experiment. This would involve to see whether we would have access to lottery winners, how could we incentive them to participate in the experiment, how to properly set up the controls, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            I would set up an advisory board to ensure academic recognition (this worked particularly well when we launched the Basic Income Studies journal).
          </li>

          <li>
            I would thoroughly document all the process, extracting which are the main lessons learnt and allowing for it to be easily replicated in the near future.
          </li>

          <li>
            I would like to write a personal blog as well. We could call it “Basic Incoming” :)
          </li>

          <li>
            I would organize international panels, conferences and other non-academic activities, to communicate the main results, publicize the experiment as much as possible and teach people its insights.
          </li>

          <li>
            We would be in permanent contact with the teams running the European experiments, to ensure mutual recognition and a proper flow of information.
          </li>

          <li>
            We would promote specific academic research on the data drawn from the experiment, looking for experts and students interested in exploiting the data and writing papers or thesis on it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        </p>

        </h3>

        <p>
          In my resume you can see I launched a startup in the gaming industry some time ago. It was a small project which is now led by another of the cofounders, but I honestly think it taught me some entrepreneurial values you might consider an asset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Running this experiment will surely pose a lot of practical challenges and might require the participation of different expert people at several stages. I believe I can find that support and bring the right people in. Moreover, I can efficiently manage the budget and raise more funding, while facing unexpected obstacles with a decisive, problem-solving attitude.
        </p>

        <p>
          YC is doing research <em>for the benefit of the world</em>, a mission I feel myself fully aligned with. For that purpose, we need to ensure this experiment has a deep, long term impact in people’s understanding on BI (just like <em>Basic Income Studies</em> did). I believe I can make that happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m thus convinced I can be a very good match for this position. I will design a rigorous scientific approach, lead the project determinedly and get the necessary knowledge and personal support from my BI contact network. I am definitely as passionate about this project as you can get and I'm looking forward to starting as soon as possible!
        </p>
